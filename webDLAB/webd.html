            <h1>HTML</h1>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML
            file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of
            multimedia on
            a webpage.

            HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all
            major
            web browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the
            specification.

            <h2>How HTML works</h2>
            HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the
            web
            server that it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in
            virtually any text editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.

            The most basic of HTML conventions is the inclusion of a document type declaration at the beginning of the
            text
            file. This always comes first in the document, because it is the piece that affirmatively informs a computer
            that this is an HTML file. The document header typically looks like this:
            <!DOCTYPE html>. It should always be written that way, without any content inside it or breaking it up. Any
            content that comes before this declaration will not be recognized as HTML by a computer.

            Doctypes are not just used for HTML, they can apply to the creation of any document that uses SGML (Standard
            Generalized Markup Language). SGML is a standard for specifying a specific markup language being used. HTML
            is
            one of several markup languages that SGML and doctype declarations apply to.

            The other critical requirement for creating an HTML file is saving it with a .html file extension. Whereas
            the
            doctype declaration signals HTML to the computer from the inside of the file, the file extension signals
            HTML to
            the computer from the outside of the file. By having both, a computer can tell that it's an HTML file
            whether
            it's reading the file or not. This becomes especially important when uploading the files to the web, because
            the
            web server needs to know what to do with the files before it can send them to a client computer for the
            inner
            contents to be read.

            After writing the doctype and saving as an HTML file, a user can implement all the other syntactic tools of
            HTML
            to customize a web page. Once finished, they will likely have several HTML files corresponding to various
            pages
            of the website. It's important that the user uploads these files in the same hierarchy that they saved them
            in,
            as each page references the specific file paths of the other pages, enabling links between them. Uploading
            them
            in a different order will cause links to break and pages to be lost, because the specified file paths will
            not
            match the pages.

            <h2>Basic elements of HTML</h2>
            Using HTML, a text file is further marked up with additional text describing how the document should be
            displayed. To keep the markup separate from the actual content of the HTML file, there is a special,
            distinguishing HTML syntax that is used. These special components are known as HTML tags. The tags can
            contain
            name-value pairs known as attributes, and a piece of content that is enclosed within a tag is referred to as
            an
            HTML element.

            HTML elements always have opening tags, content in the middle and closing tags. Attributes can provide
            additional information about the element and are included in the opening tag. Elements can be described in
            one
            of two ways:

            Block-level elements start on a new line in the document and take up their own space. Examples of these
            elements
            include headings and paragraph tags.
            Inline elements do not start on a new line in the document and only take up necessary space. These elements
            usually format the contents of block-level elements. Examples of inline elements include hyperlinks and text
            format tags.
